# MDSAP Task 1-3 Quality policy and objectives

<RegLang>
  Chapter 1 Task 3 - 'A quality policy is comprised of one or more statements of the medical device
  organization’s intentions and direction with respect to meeting agreed requirements. Top
  management must establish the quality policy and ensure quality objectives are established that
  are consistent with the quality policy. Top management must ensure that the quality policy is
  understood and communicated at all levels of the medical device organization. An assessment of
  whether the medical device organization’s quality system is satisfying the established quality
  policy and objectives should be a topic addressed during management reviews.'

<Subtask actionitem="Confirm the quality policy is established.">
  Most organization's <Qdoc>quality policy</Qdoc> looks strikingly similar, and will follow the
  strict aspects of ISO 13485:2016. Seasoned medical device professionals will acknowledge that in
  reality, the <Qdoc>quality policy</Qdoc> is mostly handwaving and has no actual effect on quality.
  Teams usually mirror ISO 13485's language and that's fine.

<Subtask actionitem="Confirm quality objectives are established. Review the status and progress towards the objectives.">

<Qdoc>Quality objectives</Qdoc> are measurable and either project based (i.e. 'complete EU MDR transition')
and long-running metric (i.e. complaint rate standardized by sales volumes). It is a best practice for
teams to have objectives that cover many specific parts of the quality management system, though many
teams will have objectives only for a select few processes (i.e. complaints, suppliers, and audits).{' '}

<Qdoc>Quality objectives</Qdoc> are commonly established either in a procedure or at each management
review (i.e. reflected in the minutes or presentation).{' '}

Review the <Qdoc>management review presentation</Qdoc> to confirm the status and progress of the objectives is knowable through the data analysis. Acknowledge that the <Qdoc>Task 1-9</Qdoc> is intended review the entire management review presentation, so a preliminary review focused on quality objectives is expected here.

Where objectives are not met or an undesirable trend exist, confirm the team has adequate monitoring and takes action commensurate with the risk. Management review meeting minutes could serve as objective evidence that top management has evaluated the issue when no action is taken for unmet objectives.
