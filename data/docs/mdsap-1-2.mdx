  The appointment of the management repr. is typically in a procedure, organizational chart,
  appointment letter, or memo. It is to be approved by top management or the most senior member of
  management.

<Subtask actionitem="Review established responsibilities and authorities of the management representative.">
Overarching responsibilities are typically established in a procedure or job description. It is also common for individual procedures (such as complaint or CAPA) to describe that the management representative is to have specific approvals or roles.

Records reviewed throughout the audit contribute to the evidence that the management representative participates as required. For example, one would expect to see the management representative on a management review attendance sheet and sign off on changes which impact the QMS or marketing authorization.
