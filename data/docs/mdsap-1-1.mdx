<Subtask actionitem="Review the quality manual">
  QMS planning is reflected by a <Qdoc>Quality Manual</Qdoc> with an appropriate scope of
  regulations, standards, and processes. Consider the organization's products' class and type when
  developing expectations. For example, US manufacturers would be expected to have 21 CFR 820
  Quality System Regulation included within the QMS criteria. <br /> The <Qdoc>Quality Manual</Qdoc>{' '}
  also is to describe what processes make up the QMS and make it knowable how to identify
  corresponding procedures that will be used throughout the audit.
</Subtask>

QMS planning may possibly by reflected by certification of the QMS to ISO 13485. Review any available certificate and compare scope and criteria against the established <Qdoc>Quality Manual</Qdoc>.

Throughout the audit, continue to assess whether other procedures scope and criteria match those established in this task.

QMS planning is also reflected by a list of procedures that provide initial evidence of what instruction makes up the QMS. These will be sampled throughout the audit.

Logistically, it is essential to have a <Qdoc>Document Index</Qdoc> to be able to accurately log document IDs and have visbility to available QMS instruction.

## QMS Change planning

A team may need to make changes to the QMS for a variety of reasons, some of the most common being the following.

- new product class or type with unique requirements
- new market
- new facility
- new outsourced processes

Review the <Qdoc>Change Control Procedures</Qdoc> include instruction on these changes.

<ActionItem>
  Ask the management representative and/or other team members if such changes have occurred.
