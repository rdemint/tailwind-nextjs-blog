# MDSAP Task 1-1 QMS Planning

<RegLang>
  MDSAP Task 1-1. Confirm that quality management system planning is performed to ensure that all
  required processes are identified, documented, implemented, monitored and maintained in order to
  conform to the applicable requirements and meet quality objectives. Verify that changes to the
  quality management system are managed to maintain the conformity of the quality management system
  and of the devices produced. Verify that a quality manual has been documented.

<Subtask actionitem="Review the quality manual and document index.">
  QMS planning is reflected by a <Qdoc>Quality Manual</Qdoc> with an appropriate scope of
  regulations, standards, and processes. Consider the organization's product(s) class and type. For
  example, US manufacturers would be expected to have 21 CFR 820 Quality System Regulation included
  within the QMS criteria. Make note of exclusions and non-applicable requirements which set
  expectations for later audit activities. The <Qdoc>Quality Manual</Qdoc> also is to describe what
  processes make up the QMS and make it knowable how to identify corresponding procedures that will
  be used throughout the audit. Most teams maintain a <Qdoc>document index</Qdoc> which also make
  these procedures knowable. Logistically, it is essential to have a <Qdoc>Document Index</Qdoc> for
  the audit to be able to accurately log document IDs and have visbility to available QMS
  instruction.
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem="Review any QMS certificates">
  QMS planning may possibly by reflected by certification of the QMS to ISO 13485. Review any
  available certificate and compare scope and criteria against the established{' '}
  <Qdoc>Quality Manual</Qdoc>. <br />
  <br />
  Throughout the audit, continue to assess whether other procedures scope and criteria match those
  established in this task.
</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem="Review change control procedures for instruction on QMS changes.">
A team may need to make changes to the QMS for a variety of reasons, some of the most common being the following.

- new product class or type with unique requirements
- new market
- new facility
- new outsourced processes

Confirm the <Qdoc>Change Control Procedures</Qdoc> includes instruction on these changes.

</Subtask>

<Subtask actionitem="Identify if QMS changes have occurred.">
  Ask the management representive and/or supporting team members if changes have occured in the previous two years.  If a change has occured, sample records from the change to evaluate against the internal procedures.

Be open to the possibility that a team member misspeaks or forgets about QMS changes, and this is to be further substantiated throughout the audit. In particular, many teams maintain <Qdoc>Document Change Log</Qdoc> that an auditor should be able to see summary of changes, and this review can verify that changes have not occured.
