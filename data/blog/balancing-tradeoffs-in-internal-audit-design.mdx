An internal audit is a balance of tradeoffs. Time is of the essence, and your team being audited should be intentional about directing the use of this time.

# Establishing audit objectives and priorities up-front

In many internal audits, the internal auditor's style tends to direct exactly how the audit will go. This is one benefit of contracting out audits and even using different internal auditors, sometimes you can luck out and benefit from the variety.

However, for best results, your team should be contributing to establishing the priorities of the audit. The time to establish these priorities and expectations is before the audit starts, so that no one comes across as trying to directly influence the interpretation of depth of sampling for an in-progress audit activity.

# Breadth vs. depth

The classic dilemna, do you go big and wide or narrow and deep for your audit priorities? In reality no audit is one or the other, and we can imagine the possibilities as falling along a continuous spectrum. Let's reflect on factors that will help us determine what to aim for.

## Cover all processes regardless

Let's acknowledge that most team's internal audit programs require all quality management system processes to be audited at the audit frequency (typically annually). Whether your program sprinkles the audit days throughout the year or has them all at once, ensure that all processes of the QMS are covered.

I emphasize this because a depth audit for most teams still needs to have 100% breadth. The audit still needs to cover all processes, even if certain areas of prioritized.

## Stay nuanced in your risk based approach

Strive to be nuanced in your risk based approach, and stay away from high-level assertions like 'Design and development is more risky than document control'.

I've seen both design and development and document control issues result in the release of nonconforming product.

Sure, the MDSAP grading system buckets ISO 13485 clauses into 'direct' and 'indirect' clauses, but you should strive to use the context of your team, audit history, changes, etc. to be more nuanced in setting priorities.

I try to look at changes in a more nuanced way to set priorities for the audit.

## Changes to personnel

New personnel may not be following the QMS process. This may expose issues in the training processes, level of detail of the QMS Process Instruction.

Prioritize records depending on 1) significance of QMS process and 2) experience of personnel

## Changes in product scope

Have unique documents and records been generated, such as design and development risk management documentation? This unique content has never been audited.

Prioritize unique documents and records. This reflect the current health of processes and personnel understanding, so this is important information.

# Interviews vs. document review

As an auditor, I can probably review three to ten times as many records on my own, compared to a team member explaining these records to me.

We can acknowledge that there is value in both approaches.

# Audit priorities may evolve throughout the audit

It is not possible to plan and structure the entire audit.

Audit priorities can and should change based on objective evidence reviewed in the audit.

But these are changes are well informed, and can better be compared against other priorities because the other priorities have been made explicit in the audit design. As opposed to, ‘well I’m the auditor and I think going down this rabbit hole is a good idea'.
