summary: An internal audit is just a sampling, and an auditor can't (and shouldn't) audit everything equally.  You should establish clear objectives for the audit so you make sure the right areas receive the right amount of attention.

# Establishing audit objectives and priorities before the audit

An internal auditor's style, skills, and comfort areas often determine which areas receive deeper sampling. This is not ideal, but especially true for less experienced auditors.

This variation can be a benefit, but it also can also be a drawback if your auditor's style, skills, and comfort areas do not align with what _actually_ needs to be audited based on the data and context related to;

- overarching QMS changes
- process changes
- product changes
- personnel changes
- etc.

Your team should establish their own priorities for the internal audit in order to safeguard against;

- auditors who tend to sample deeper only in their areas of expertise or comfort and
- auditors who are weak in the skill of adjusting sampling based on data and context.

The time to establish these priority areas is before the internal audit starts, based on your team's data and context. While we all wish we could count on auditors to take care of this without the extra input, this is not the reality.

## Stay nuanced in your risk-based approach

Setting audit priorities based on your team's data and context is an effort to follow a risk-based approach.

Strive to be nuanced in your thinking. Data and context unique to your team is more meaningful than high-level approaches such as 'Design and Development is more risky than Document Control'.

Let's continue by exploring some specific data and context that can help you establish internal audit objectives.

### New or heavily modified QMS

Some teams are coming to market for the first time, or may have overhauled their quality management system with new procedures. In this scenario, a well-balanced audit across all systems is usually called for.

In this scenario, there is usually no grounds for believing any one part of the system is stronger than the other. These teams need to establish a baseline and general confidence.

### New or heavily modified processes

It is common for teams to replace or heavily modify one or more quality management system processes. This scenario usually calls for a deeper sampling in the modified process(es).

When budgeting extra time and audit sampling for such processes, take into consideration any verification of effectiveness activities that have already taken place for this new process (e.g. through a CAPA). A strong and already complete CAPA Verification of Effectiveness (VoE) could be reason not to prioritize review of modified areas, but in my experience this would be uncommon as many teams rely on internal audits for at least partial evidence of long-term effectiveness.

### Changes to personnel

A team member leaving the team or moving to a new position could be a reason for deeper sampling in the related QMS process.

The goal in this scenario is to assess timeliness and effectiveness of the team's training process. This emphasis on the training process should be clear to everyone, so that individuals (as opposed to the process) do not feel singled out or attacked.

### Changes to product scope

Since new products call for new documentation that has never been audited, this scenario usually calls for deeper sampling of the new-product documentation.

It would not be uncommon for an audit to only or primarily sample new-product related documents and records for one or more QMS process (especially in design and development).

### Significant quality events

Significant quality events may indicate the need to sample deeper in some areas. Quality events may be an early warning that something has changed or is not as expected. Quality events are particularly valuable as insight because they often reveal breakdowns between interacting quality management system processes.

Such quality events could include:

- recalls
- internal audit
- nonconforming product
- complaint trends
- management reviews
- corrective action

For example, commercial nonconforming product that has a root cause in the previous design transfer and document control may be deserving of a deep dive to understand how the issue propagated and was not caught.

### Interviews vs. document review

As an auditor, I'd guess I can review three to ten times as many records on my own compared to a team member explaining these records to me.

We can acknowledge that there is value in both approaches. Generally, I try to blend both approaches and advocate that each functional area should have a team member participate and speak to their own processes in the internal audit.

I find the following approach consistently works well and blends the approaches. I (the auditor) take a few minutes to read the procedure. The SME (auditee) then explains the procedure to me in their own words, and then walks me through one or two records from that procedure (e.g. CAPA, NCR). From there, I'll review more records on my own and ask questions as needed.

# Establish your own objectives

In summary, your team should have priorities and objectives for each internal audit based on data and your team's context.

This can be contrasted with an auditor who thinks, ‘_well I’m the auditor and I think going down this rabbit hole is a good idea._' Auditors don't always pick the direction that deserves the most sampling.

While the auditor is to have a level of freedom to direct the audit as it unfolds based on sampling and professional judgment, this freedom should be balanced with priorities that your team has established ahead of time based on data and context. This ensures that a risk-based approach is taken.

Some auditors can really 'go off the rails' in their own creative direction, or simply lack skills in adjusting sampling based on data and context. Pointing out to an auditor that the audit is beginning to diverge from the agreed-upon audit objectives can be a professional and courteous way to reel them back in.

Keep fighting the good fight in making your internal audits valuable.
