## QMS size is not everything

QMS size (i.e., number of documents, pages) is often talked about as if size determines how good a QMS is.ü§î

Sure, we can acknowledge the terrors of a QMS becoming a big, impenetrable, and convoluted wall of text. But big is not always bad, and small is not always good. Small may mean no answers, no instruction, and no tools.

In classic RAQA style, we have to acknowledge ‚Äòit depends‚Äô. üòè

While it of course it depends on the scope of your business and team size, here I just want to focus on two characteristics of the QMS itself. Density and findability.

## QMS Density - no room for fluff

To make analogy to the physical world, a QMS needs to be as wide and deep as necessary to hold useful instruction, answers, and tools.

But relative to QMS size, how much room is given for fluffy, mushy, ambiguous, formal, unused, or otherwise unhelpful language? When QMS size is driven by use and function, we can call a QMS 'dense'. Density is created through well-written content that is created for users and not auditors.
"Does your QMS instructional content feel mushy and lack density, or does it answer our questions?"

## QMS Findability - ease of getting to answers

Findability is our antidote to QMS size. Let‚Äôs think about the web to get the concept - the web is incredibly useful, but it is not useful because it is small.

The web is useful because it is large enough to have relevant information and smart enough to make that information highly findable. Just as with the web, size should not determine findability in the QMS.

Whether or not your electronic document system has a search function, the goal is to increase;

- Between-document findability: The ease to arrive at the right document(s) and ignore others.
- Within-document findability: The ease to find answers within the sections of any given ‚Äòright‚Äô document(s).

Findability is created with QMS architecture and document design. While these topics are big in themselves and we will explore them over time, for now I just encourage reflection on the following questions to get a primer.

_How many different documents do I have to look through before I can find the document that has my answer?_

We should never have to look at more than 3 or 4 documents before finding an answer. There should be mappings, groupings, and hierarchies to help us arrive at the right document quickly.

_How many pages of a document do I have to look through before I find the section that has my answer?_

Table of contents, task-sized sections, descriptively named sections, and task-based content all help in teams members getting to specific answers, faster.

I am always curious how different teams think about and manage QMS size. Which is better to your team, a 30 page procedure or 3, 10 page procedures?
