# The intent is design

Many similarities could be pointed out between the design and development process of a Quality Management System (QMS) and an RAQA professional. Both the design process and the RAQA professional ensures that requirements are captured, documented, and met by using principles and patterns.  
The way I see it now, RAQA professionals are responsible for designing or influencing the design of plenty.

### Designing systems and processes

The quality management system has a significant impact on the productivity, sanity, and end-results of team efforts. If you can influence the design of the QMS, you can have a big impact on the team.

### Designing products

Many of the questions and guidance provided by RAQA influence device design, even if an RAQA team member doesn't have specialized product knowledge. In my experience, the systematic questioning (i.e. requirements and risks) we build into the process does tend to highlight gaps and/or weak spots that product designers haven't considered.

### Designing information

RAQA professionals often take a lead on documented information, which is foundational to systems, processes, and products. We've all experienced the joy of documented information that quickly provides answers (i.e. Google) and the frustration of information that does not provide answers (your QMS?).

Your QMS isn't Google or Youtube, but it still should help team members find the information they are looking for. Whether it is the high-level document structure or the nuanced details of formatting and templates, the large and small decisions heavily influence the usability of your documented information.

# Taking inspiration from specialty disciplines

All of the above is to say that RAQA does quite a bit of designing. There are of course specialty disciplines which take the design of all of these areas quite seriously, including but not limited to

- systems engineering
- industrial design
- human-computer interaction
- usability engineering
- process engineering
- instructional design
- user experience design
- software development
- interaction design
- graphic design
- information architecture
- data visualization
- and so on

I inspiration from thinkers and resources on some of these topics. It is relatively easy to pick up a few tips and tricks to improve some aspect of what you,as an RAQA professional, design. If you are looking for an easy place to get started, how about starting with your Word templates, setting up styles so you can automatically create styles and table of contents to make your documents more usable?

# Find inspiration in one other discipline

The point is to encourage you to think about RAQA as design work. It turns out we have a lot to gain from other disciplines that are tackling similar problems. I suggest that you try cherry-picking low-hanging fruit offered by at least one other discipline. You'll increase the value and perspective you bring to the team, and you may even be able to find your work more interesting. You may even tap into some creativity that you didn't even know you had.

> RAQA will remain a cost center until we start taking our responsibility as system/process/information designers, as seriously as the regulations and standards take device design.

I'm always curious, for the RAQA out there, which one other discipline you would pick to learn and why?

For everyone affected by RAQA, which one other discipline would you wish your RAQA team member would learn and why?
