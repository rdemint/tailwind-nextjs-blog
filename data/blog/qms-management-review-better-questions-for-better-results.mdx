summary: A QMS Management Review should answer real questions about the business and the QMS.  Teams get better results by focusing on the questions they want to answer, rather than the form of the data they have.

Does your team dread your annual QMS management review? Are there murmurs of making it a shorter presentation every year?

Do you start out the presentation with 'We gather here today because 21 CFR 820 and ISO 13485 say we have to...'?

What if management review answered questions that team members actually cared about, and still fulfilled QMS requirements?

In order to get closer to this better reality, your team needs to ask better questions and find out what is important to the team.

# A hypothetical CAPA presentation slide

Imagine the following data is presented on a management review slide for Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA). Too many CAPA management review slides look like this (yes, really).

- CAPAs Open: 2
- CAPAs Closed: 4

This data checks the box, but it doesn’t answer questions.

We are left to wonder, _is this team in a desirable scenario, or an undesirable one_? _Do they need to take action or no_? We don’t know.

# Examples of better CAPA questions

What would some better questions be, that would help us identify more meaningful data and metrics to put on this slide?

## Are we taking corrective action when needed?

"Do we have CAPA open covering our known issues? Didn't somebody mention last month we needed a CAPA for document control? Has this been started?"

"We see six CAPA mentioned on this slide, is this desirable or undesirable? Should we have more or less CAPA open given our context and known issues?"

## How significant are the issues we are taking action on?

"We get that registrars and notified bodies will require us to do some handwaving now and then. So how significant are these issues, really? Are we talking about document clarifications or real risk here?"

## Are we getting things done in a timely manner?

"Are the investigations and actions getting done by the due dates? Are we routinely stuck?"

"How long have these issue been open, and is this longer than desirable? I understand we often do the Verification of Effectiveness (VoE) for three months or so, so help me understand how VoE affects the aging metrics?"

## Where in the process are we getting stuck?

"Are we struggling with investigations? How about corrective action planning? How about implementation? Does this have anything to do with our broken-AF document control process?"

## Are we effective in getting to root cause or are we seeing repeat issues?

"Do we routinely identify the real root cause so that our actions prevent the issues from recurring? Or are we opening CAPA for the same things over and over again?"

## Are we seeing a trend in areas of our quality management system?

"Are an undesirable amount of our CAPA coming from one area of our system such as training, design control, etc.?"

# Survey management for other good questions

While we explored a hypothetical CAPA example above, the point is to incorporate better questions throughout management review.

The management review attendees should come together to form a list of interesting questions well in advance of putting any presentation together. These questions guide the data to be in the presentation.

It may be helpful to think about the following themes when developing other questions.

- Why has one method of analysis been chosen in the past as opposed to another analysis?
- Are the observed results good? How do the results relate to our objectives and goals?
- Are the observed results to be expected? What circumstances and context are surrounding what we see?
- Is our process working? Are we getting things done?
- Are our resources commensurate with the problem? Are resources stuck in some way?

Note: these interesting questions should _definitely_ not all come from Quality/Regulatory, to make sure they reflect the concerns of the entire team.

We should also acknowledge that different team members will be interested in different management review topics (i.e. CAPA, production scrap, NCR, new products, etc.). Regardless, still survey all attendees for questions on all topics, and you might just get some unexpected ideas on how to make these topics more relevant to everyone.

# Find the depth that works for your team

Your team will have to find that balance of depth that makes management review work for everyone.

Asking better questions will take longer and is more work. But the team might be less resistant to this than you'd expect if the management review is actually answering questions they care about.

Building trust through listening to the questions and concerns of your team will go a long way.

Remind yourselves when you get stuck that "we don't want to dread our management review. We really do have some questions that need to be answered. We can check the box and make it worthwhile, too."
