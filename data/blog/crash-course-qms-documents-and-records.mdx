What is the real _essence_ of quality management system (QMS) requirements in sources like 21 CFR 820, ISO 13485:2016, and MDSAP? What is the potential business value?

Whether you're a jaded seasoned medtech professional or needing to pitch the idea of a QMS to someone new, let's review the emphasis on

- process,
- documents, and
- records

# Process

## Consistent quality comes from consistency

Einstein is quoted as saying 'Insanity is doing the same thing, over and over again and expecting a different result.'

What is the opposite of this? Doing the same thing over and over again because you _want_ to continue to get the same [good] results. That's process. And good process will consistently give us good results.

# Documents

## Written down stuff is more valuable than thought stuff

The fundamental premise of the quality management system is that it is valuable to capture important information in words and pictures. This premise can sound elementary at first glance, but it the premise of the modern world.

Written down information lives across time, space, and boundaries. It extends our abilities to accomplish what we need to in the world.

## You have problems and someone has an answer (too bad they're not available right now)

At a high level, documented information is important because it allows us to get answers and pose questions on our own schedule. Ultimately, this allows us to answer more questions and get more done than we would otherwise.

Thatâ€™s why we email, text, slack, Google, and YouTube, right?

You have questions and someone has an answer (or they can at least point you in the right direction). 'How am I to get this work done?' is a fundamental question we need to answer day in and day out.

Your quality management system should be effective in providing answers to work-related questions. It does this primarily by being the living source of important documented information.

Your QMS may not be as sexy as Google in it's answer-providing-abilities, but there's always opportunity for improvement.

# Records

## You can't remember everything and be everywhere all the time

In the common use of the terms, documents are about the present/future and records are about the past. Of course we often gain insight from the past to know what to do in the present, and so records often tell us about a;

- meeting
- decision
- approval
- analysis
- investigation
- problem
- change
- or some other event

Unless you're one of those team members who thinks everything can be solved by calling yet another meeting, it's not much of a stretch to see there is power and business value in records.

You weren't in the meeting. You didn't do the analysis. Maybe you weren't even at the company at the time.

No problem, because QMS records will help you put the details together so that you can still contribute, today.

# Where does it all go wrong

We can acknowledge that process, documents, and records have benefits, but they also have cost and downsides.
We've all experienced the dark side of written-down stuff, too.

- Those instructions that were incomprehensible.
- That file or email you just can't seem to find.
- The redundant form to be filled out.
- The lengthy written-out response that could've been a quick meeting or phone call.

# Keeping the ideal in mind

Writing stuff down takes time to do and time to update, no getting around that. The fundamental premise and ideal of the quality management system is that the cost is to be worth the value gained.

As medical device industry professionals, we're collectively working together to make this ideal a reality. We will not settle for the drudgery of paperwork just to check the compliance box that must be checked. We are to make the quality management system work for us. The QMS should ultimately be there to help us get the right work done.
