How do you and your team feel about the following statements?

> "Our QMS internal audit program is valued by all departments. Team members of all levels are clear on the value we are aiming to capture on audit days."

1. Strongly disagree
2. Disagree
3. Neutral
4. Agree
5. Strongly agree

Did you laugh out loud? Most teams I encounter are somewhere in the 1-3 range. Most teams are not clear on the value to be gained from their QMS internal audits and are therefore consistently not capturing as much value as they could be.

Often team members are just not convinced there actually is value in an internal audit. They get audited because they have to.

Sure, you _have to have_ your internal audit because of 21 CFR 820 or ISO 13485, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't make it worth your while.

In this post I'll suggest some value-areas your team should try to focus on, but first we have to tell it like it is.

# Concede that audits are hard

Before you go around trying to pump up your audit and how valuable it is, consider that your team members may still have the perception that all audits are terrible, no good, very bad days.

Let's not be romantic about it, audits are hard.

And if you and the team are really searching for issues, really having meaningful discussions, really making linkages, and really reflecting on opportunities to improve, then audits are strenuous mental work and you are going to be tired at the end of the day.

The good news is that they don't have to be made much harder, to be much more worth doing. Encourage your team to make their heroic audit efforts worthwhile, by gaining specific things from the internal audit.

# Spread the paradigm of internal audit value

Take on the responsibility to spread the paradigm that the internal audit has value. Clearly articulate the following value-areas to your team prior to audit day and then again in the opening meeting.

While getting audited, all team members should have these in mind.

## Finding real problems before others do

This is usually intuitive to folks, but it is always a good reminder to say outright. Teams should be encouraged to remain open to the idea that mistakes happen, and problems do occur. Teams need to stay humble about their processes and we all should welcome fresh eyes on our work. Frame this in a way to free your team from blame culture. Acknowledge that your team's processes aren't perfect, to take away a bit of the suspense.

Remind your team of the advantage of finding problems before somebody else does - the customer, registrar, notified body, or FDA. Because of course if your team identifies and takes corrective action on an internal problem, external authorities are typically much more forgiving and hands-off.

## Triggering action for weak and risky areas

Often I see teams that know they have weak and risky areas but they don't take action until formally called out in an internal audit. Not ideal.

We can empathize with the fact that formal corrective actions are actually work, and when some team members create more work for other team members, there can be a resulting undesirable social dynamic. Social dynamics can discourage teams from taking formal action or at least taking it in a timely manner. Nobody wants to be _that team member_ that creates more paperwork.

Internal audits can be an opportunity to get corrective actions or improvement efforts off the ground in a more neutral way, especially if you have a contractor do your audit.

## Speaking to our own processes

Many teams are not as familiar with their processes as they think they are. We can acknowledge that there is a difference between _knowing_ how we do our work, and _explaining_ how we do our work. And so team members can find themselves stumbling over their words even if they are quite familiar with their processes.

For better or worse, speaking to our own processes is an important skill that can demonstrate competence and reduce audit friction in critical moments such as a ISO 13485 recertification audit or FDA inspection. It should be a specific internal audit goal to practice for these more critical days.

With that being said, I see too many RAQA team members answering all the audit questions for everyone else. Please let your team members speak to their processes, and speak badly, if need be. And ask your internal auditor to prioritize interviews. Practice is important.

When speaking to processes, encourage your team to use the QMS procedures as talking points. This will help team members become reacquainted with them, and often enough the team members notice changes or clarifications that should be made that the auditor often doesn't notice. Keep a 'side-list' of changes to be made.

## Experience talking with auditors

Auditors are not famous for their social skills, and while there are plenty of exceptions, I do hear the horror stories. It is important for your team members to gain experience with prolonged question and answer sessions without being drawn into negative emotions.

Audit conversation is not like typical conversation. Having even a small amount of experience with somewhat repetitive or confrontational Q&A can help team members avoid falling into the negative patterns when it really matters. These patterns could include talking too much, talking too little, getting defensive, etc.

## A pulse on the industry

If you contract out your internal audit (and you probably should), your auditor likely has a pulse on the industry. Especially if your QMS is scoped to a relatively new regulation or standard, it is likely worth your while to try to get an auditor that has been able to see how that 'newness' is being interpreted out in the wild.

Yes, interpreted. Different auditors, registrars, notified bodies, and government agencies of course have different interpretations of the same sources of quality management system requirements. Best to keep a pulse on things.

In addition to the watch-outs, your auditor should be able to offer some recommendations for improvement to align with industry best practices. Make sure to put improvement as an audit objective, and bring this up in the opening meeting.

# Are you convinced, yet?

If nothing else, your internal audit is a reason to bring some snacks into the office, right?

So are you convinced there is more value to be gained in your internal audit than you are currently capturing? Is your team?

Remember, bring these value-areas up with your team prior to the audit and in the opening meeting.

I'm always curious to hear what different teams find valuable in their internal audits, so feel free to let me know what I missed.
