Medical device teams who really want to get value out of QMS management review and engage their whole team should encourage;

1. cross-functional management presentations and
2. non-management SME presentations.

At the end of the day, these teams will be better informed to improve their QMS (and I'd bet they feel more like a team, too üôå).

# Inclusive attendance of non-management SMEs

Quality Management System management review (i.e. ISO 13485:2016 5.6) is for the management team, right? Yes üëç and no üëé.

Reviewing data is the name of the game, but usually our tables, histograms, etc. are only built to answer the basic questions. You can't include all the data, so it's important for presenters to have the context to support a rich discussion that can go beyond the slides.

Who has this context on the data? The non-management SMEs (i.e. individual contributors), of course. Your '_boots on the ground_' have unique visibility to problems that managers, by definition, should not have. With the SMEs present, the discussion isn‚Äôt limited to the data on the current slide. ü§ì

Not to mention, including your non-management team members is a great opportunity to develop and mentor them, and giving them a voice in this type of forum can go a long way to get them to engage.

# Cross-functional presentation from the management team

QMS management review is the where the Quality Representative talks at us for two to six hours, right? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hopefully not.

I consider it a best practice for the management review presentation to be a cross-functional effort, with each member of the management team presenting on their own area.

With (mostly) everyone presenting,

- we reinforce the idea that everyone shares responsibility and contributes to quality
- the team is more likely to stay engaged over the span of the meeting
- questions can flow all directions so that everyone feels heard
- data analysis likely reflects more interesting questions
- everyone can contribute their subject matter expertise for more insights

Even though not everyone will be excited about putting together some slides, it's worth trying out for these benefits.

# Adjusting for your team's culture

I realize that QMS management review comes down to organizational culture, preference, and the frequency of other QMS-related meetings outside of QMS management review.

Teams vary, a lot.

Some management teams will be more open to inclusion of the non-management team than others.

Some teams have a monthly quality review program involving strong non-management SME participation, so this type of participation may be considered less critical in the annual QMS management review.

And we can acknowledge, yes, management likely needs meetings that are only attended by management, but I would propose that QMS Management Review is _not_ one of those meetings.

To the extent your team can swing it, try encouraging

1. cross-functional management presentations and
2. non-management SME presentations.

Had some success with other practices in your team's management review? Let me know!
