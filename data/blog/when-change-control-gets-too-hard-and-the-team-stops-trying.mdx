# The risk-benefit of change control

Processes matter, but people matter too.

Yes, change control within the quality management system is important, but it is not without it's risk ü§î.

The risk is that genuinely needed changes, updates, and improvements aren't made because of the difficulty of getting changes through the change control process.

# When continuous improvement becomes a slogan on the wall

It just takes a few rounds of a well-meaning team member bringing forward ideas for improvement and having a negative experience to simply stop trying. They realize that continuous improvement is just a slogan on the wall, and then they keep quiet üò∂.

As a leader, please be on guard against this negativity seeping into your team culture.

I've most encountered these downtrodden team members in audits. It's not uncommon that somebody knew of an issue for months or years, but was too demoralized and unlistened to, to really get the change to happen.

# Listen to your team

As we go about rah-rahing about continuous improvement and sternly affirming that our QMS is implemented and effective ü§®, we should humbly remind ourselves to spend time with and listen to the people closest the work ü§ù.

We can also acknowledge that not everybody is going to fill out the QMS change control form. Maybe they _should_, but we don't live in that reality yet. Your team should have champions at different levels who help team members get through the process.

In my experience, when the team is listened too, given the opportunity, and recognized, they light up at the opportunity to make things genuinely better for the business and the other humans in it.
