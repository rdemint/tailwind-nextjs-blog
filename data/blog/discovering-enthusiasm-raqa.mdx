# A paper-based QMS in the world of artificial intelligence

It was around 2014 or 2015, when I reflected on the disturbing contrast between social media using artificial intelligence (AI) to tag users in pictures and the medical device companies that still had paper-based Quality Management Systems (QMS). People were asking questions, like, ‘Wait, do we need to validate Microsoft Word?’. In my mind, social media companies seemed about three decades ahead of us and were paving the way into the future. It seemed bizarre and wrong that less engineering supported the typical QMS compared to the typical platform of online cat-videos.

This disturbing reflection made me feel like I was in the wrong industry. I was afraid that in the medical device industry I might not develop job skills relevant to a world which looked like it was going to be ruled by software. In 2014 I had just earned a degree in Industrial Engineering where ‘work smarter, not harder’ was the name of the game. Yet in the Quality Engineer position I took immediately after graduation, I was seeing quality management systems that more resembled the paper-pushing bureaucracy depicted in movies such as ‘Office Space’.

Of course, I realized that ‘working smarter’ was _not all about_ or _even mostly about_ software, but I felt it was going to be an indispensable part of it. I never believed that complex software is necessary for a QMS, but I had a growing belief that I should be seeking out new and better ways of working and take inspiration from other disciplines and industries.

## Finding enthusiasm outside the medical device industry

My concerns over the low-tech, low-skills state of my position in the medical device industry prompted me to start taking Coursera courses on the side in other forward-moving disciplines. Software development and data science were my first explorations.

I learned some basic programing skills by discovering the world of incredible online resources (i.e., FreeCodeCamp, Coursera, Udemy, Udacity, etc.), but more importantly I was inspired by the positive and enthusiastic energy of the software developer community. I came across countless blogs and forums that were not only indispensable to my learning, but inspirational in that so many software developers were genuinely excited about their craft and were kind enough to share their learnings in online articles. The paradigm of a professional thinking about their work as a craft, and being genuinely exicted about it, was somewhat foreign to my experience by totally refreshing.

As I worked through programming lessons, I found some magic and enjoyment in the mini-challenges that each had an arch from error to success. At the beginning of the arch, there's just error, error, and error. Then some days, hours, or minutes later I would often find the right blog, forum, or book that would have the insight for me to solve my problem. Success!

## In my feelings about problem solving

The feelings I get at the end of that arch from error to success brings the fun back to problem solving and learning. First, there is the incredible relief of finding the solution after banging your head against a wall.

Second, there is the empowerment to being able to find the information to solve your own problem. The endorphins that rush through you in the moment of success seem to ask, ‘with all the information out there, what couldn’t you do?'.

Third, there is the connection to the writer that shared the gift of information with you. They’ve felt your pain. They’ve been in your shoes and persevered. And then they made a choice to pass it on.

I’ve been overdue in taking this pattern on with a medical device flavor. But better late than never!

## Spreading the enthusiasm

I hope you find an article here that gives you all the good feelings that problem solving can bring. Yes, there are some reasons to think RAQA and Quality Management Systems are actually cool.

Together, let’s explore patterns of problems and solutions that connect the medical device industry to other industries. Let’s discuss best practices that are hard won from the trenches. Let’s walk the line between elegant simplicity and complexity, and indulge in the feelings we can only realize on that arch from Error to Success.
