summary: Quality management system documentation should extend team members abilities to get things done. Writing it down once is likely cheaper and more accurate than asking three times.

# Let's be clear, thinking is not free

Our QMS processes should respect and leverage the fact that thinking is not free.  
Thinking _is_ hard work, and quality management systems should be designed and improved to help us make the most of our mental efforts so that we can unleash our teams for success. We need to stop using compliance as the excuse to maintain our QMS, and start taking responsibility to make the QMS work for our team and the business.
Yes, we should be quick to acknowledge that documentation and conversation (i.e. email) are _also_ not free. But is within our control to which leaves us with the mission of how to make a quality management system that is cheaper than the alternative.  
Do we accept this mission? In order to accept this mission, we have to believe there is some fundamental value in writing things down. Do we really believe that writing information down is better than the alternative?  
Of course we do.

- Do you text and email more often than you call?
- Have you ever had someone interrupt you to ask a question they could've looked up themselves, and felt annoyed? ('Google that shit')
- Have you ever looked back in an email to confirm something?
- Have you ever written out a list of things to shop for or things to do? Have you ever forgotten to buy something when you didn't? :)
- Have you ever used your phone to keep track of an important date or time? (i.e. birthday,meeting, etc.) Have you ever kicked yourself when you didn't? :)
- Have you ever used Google or YouTube?  
  All of the above are simple examples where documented information is leveraged because it is better than the alternative.  
  To get to the point, our QMS processes should provide us the information infrastructure to put our brain power to the best use.

# Make the QMS reduce the cost of thinking

Process, structure, and templates. They give us a framework and guardrails so that we can focus our efforts. The alternative? Reinventing the wheel. Starting from zero. Misdirecting our efforts. Racking our brains. Solving problems that have already been solved. Burnout.  
I will be the first to recognize that the quality management system can be poorly designed and contribute to inefficiency. But I accept this as the challenge cut out for us as professionals. The challenge to make quality management systems that are cheaper and better than the alternative of not writing things down.  
To make processes, that can extend the capability and performance of the team.
To memorialize the hard-won solutions and for others to leverage.
To free ourselves from the need to remember, so that maybe we could remember at least one birthday and one phone number.
