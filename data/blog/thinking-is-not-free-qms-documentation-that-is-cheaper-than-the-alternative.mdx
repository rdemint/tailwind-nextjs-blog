# Please, don't make me think

Please, [don’t make me think](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758). Not even about that birthday, or that phone number.

Why?  
Because thinking is not free.

This may be the foundational principle of quality management system design.

Let's reflect that the products, websites, and experiences we love don’t make us do any _extra_ thinking, they;

- minimize what we have to think about, and/or
- provide a ramp and guardrails to roll us in the right direction.

They 10x our thinking. They respect that it's not free.

Shouldn’t this be true for our quality documentation? Isn’t this the purpose of the quality management system - To make it easier for teams, not harder?

# Please, just give me MedTech superpowers

Reflect on a product that has given you that magical feeling - where it felt like the product was an extension of yourself.

Great products make us feel like we have superpowers, helping us _do_ without _extra_ thinking.

Quality management systems should be your MedTech team’s superpower to get to market, create the required design documentation, and deliver something incredible.

For example, I’ve seen time and time again how a structured design and development process actually teased out important design aspects that designers and engineers hadn’t yet thought of.

If you remain skeptical, I’d suspect that you have been burned by a bad QMS in the past or are vastly underestimating the thinking and work required to put and keep a medical device on the market.

It's hard to start from zero. The truth is, you need a starter, a toolkit, a framework, and some guardrails. That's a QMS. Thinking is not free, and your quality documentation should give your team superpowers to make sure the right work gets done.
