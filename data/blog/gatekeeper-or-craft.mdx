# Really, how does RAQA sleep at night?

Have you felt the tension? Do you sense the stares? Does your team hush or look away when you approach?

Do you find yourself on a team that has the paradigm that RAQA stands in the way of work getting done?

One event related to this stands out in my mind. A manager on a team I was working with asks me, with obvious doubt,

> ‘So this RAQA and compliance stuff is what gets you going, huh? Can you honestly say that it is not a total drudgery to always be the bad guy?
> This RAQA stuff is really your reason for dragging yourself out of the bed in the morning and you can still look at yourself in the mirror?’

I think, what _fantastic questions_ - I instantly liked this manager. I've been asking myself hard questions like this for years. It is important to me to be making contributions rather than being part of the problem, and part of the journey is understanding our own answers to these questions. I've considered many questions such as.

- Am I part of the problem, or part of the solution?
- Do I help manifest the costs or benefits of compliance and standardization?
- Am I making the cost of the quality system worth it?
- Has the checkbox mentality rubbed off on me?
- Do I have the vision to see when the documented information is valuable vs. when it is not?
- Do I resort to fearmongering about compliance because I am insecure in the value I can add to an organization? Would people see the value in quality management systems even if they weren't a requirement?
- Have I earned my seat at the business table?
  The common paradigm of RAQA being limited to compliance leaves me deeply unsatisfied. Don't get me wrong, compliance is an important aspect of it, but I also believe RAQA can, must, and will level-up as a discipline to change the paradigm to a more effective one. Wouldn't this be consistent with our own principles?

# Trying to envision a better paradigm

I am driven to contribute to the shift of the industry paradigm of what RAQA is about. In all transparency, I will certainly focus more on the QA than than the RA. I am trying to realize a vision where quality management systems are a competitive advantage and an essential business tool, rather than a checkbox.
After all, teams have important work to do, getting medical devices to market, keeping them there, and continuing to innovate.
Work like this is the _right_ work. The _neccessary_ work. And quality management systems _can_ help teams get work done. Of course they can get in the way too, by creating the _accidental_ and _unnecessary_ work from poor design and implementation.

Could we envision a paradigm where RAQA is a craft about ensuring the right work gets done?
I believe this paradigm is to be achieved through better quality management systems. And this of course starts with conversations of _better_. I hope you join me for many explorations on the topic.

What paradigm resonates with you? What do you say?
