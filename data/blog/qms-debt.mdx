QMS Debt describes the unnecessary costs (work, time, etc.) generated by sub-optimal quality management systems. You know youâ€™re in QMS Debt when your QMS isâ€¦

- mind numbing ðŸ¥±
- bloated ðŸ¤¨
- complex ðŸ¤”
- outdated ðŸ˜²
- incorrect ðŸ˜®
- redundant ðŸ˜£
- burdensome ðŸ˜’
- prickly and terrible ðŸ‘º

Is this true for you and your team? How does your team respond? Does your teamâ€¦

- tell yourself your â€˜too busyâ€™ and accumulate inefficiencies and workarounds ?
- rah-rah about continuous improvement, but always push it off some future date?
- blame RAQA, itâ€™s their QMS anyways? ðŸ™„
- regularly pay down your QMS debt?

Regardless of what you tell yourself and do, the costs to the team morale and the business are real and all the same.

I recognize that â€˜continuous improvementâ€™ can sound luxurious and idealistic to some. I like the truthiness in the QMS Debt paradigm - your problems are growing if youâ€™re not paying them down, continuously.

QMS Debt comes from flaws in your QMS that grow in significance over time as changes are made. Your QMS is constantly becoming more outdated, incorrect, and bloated as your business changes and the medical device regulatory landscape changes around you. Over time, the QMS increases friction for your team by slowing productivity and increasing costs.

Just like you have to _spend money to make money_, you have to _work on your QMS if itâ€™s going to work for you_.

Working on your QMS means keeping it up-to-date, correct, and functional. Sure, sometimes we take shortcuts, but thatâ€™s not a winning long-term strategy. Debt doesnâ€™t disappear. In the long term, staying out of QMS Debt is the only way to stay agile and feel that satisfaction of getting the right work done (without the extra busywork).

Start with your teamâ€™s pain points, start small, and schedule in time to pay down QMS Debt. Go find out, what is prickly and terrible about your QMS to your team?
